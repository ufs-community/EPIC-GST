# EPIC-GST
This repo will contain scripts to build the hpc-stack and the UFS SRW application for use with the graduate student test.
The intial set of scripts will use gnu 9.3.0 compilers and openmpi. The version of hpc-stack is on a branch called
feature/singularity and contains some changes from the head of develop that allow the stack to build without 
intervention.
